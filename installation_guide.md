# Step by step guide

## 1. Set default python executable to python3.x
* Check if python 3.x is installed.
    * If not, install python>=3.5.
* Check if command `python` opens python3.x
    * If command `python` opens a python3.y, you will need to set the default python executable by these commands:
    * `sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2 2`
    * `sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 3`
    * now by default will be used the 3.x version
    * (it can be reverted back to python2.y by running command: `sudo update-alternatives --config python` and selecting 2.y version)

## 2. Install required dependencies

* Run these commands:
    * `sudo apt install nodejs npm python3-pip`
    * `pip3 install --user pipenv cookiecutter autopep8`
    * `PATH="$(python -m site --user-base)/bin:${PATH}"`

## 3. Run the cookiecutter to kickstart the project

* Run this command:
    * `cookiecutter https://github.com/dede64/cookiecutter-django-shop`
